# FC-Taylor Program

Full constraint (FC) Taylor program useful for generating discrete yield surface data. The program uses the hypoelastic implementation in the SIMLab Crystal Mechanics Model (SCMM-hypo) for solving the single crystal response of each individual grain.

## Usage

See the SCMM-hypo manual for details.
